This exercise is about **inverse probability weighting** and **marginal structural models** to estimate population-average potential outcomes of the form $E(Y^a)$. The exercise has two coding goals and three conceptual goals.

Coding goals:

1. Practice the inverse probability weighting estimator
2. Practice the marginal structural model estimator

Conceptual goals:
1. See the mathematical equivalence of IPW and outcome modeling
2. See a setting where MSM outperforms both IPW and outcome modeling
	- This occurs because $E(Y^a)$ is linear
3. See how performance changes with sample size and with stabilized weights

The exercise is a available in an HTML file generated by RMarkdown (code also available).
