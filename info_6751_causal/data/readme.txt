# readme for info_6751_causal/data

The data files in this folder are taken from publicly-available sources.

## lecture_10.csv

This file is Simulation 1 from Dorie et al. (2019), which are accessed through the [aciccomp](https://github.com/vdorie/aciccomp) package. I modified the file to contain a pre-labeled train/test split. See data prep code in [info_6751_causal/code_examples/lecture_10_prepare_data.R](https://github.com/ilundberg/teaching/tree/master/info_6751_causal/code_examples/lecture_10_prepare_data.R).
