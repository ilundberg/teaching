\section{Group Exercises}

%\subsection{Design a randomized trial}

\tcframe

\begin{frame}{Part 1) Design a randomized trial}

\Large
This page had links to Google docs for 8 groups to work on the exercise (see exercise on next slides)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Odd numbered groups}
You are a medical researcher focused on high blood pressure. Your research points toward a new drug—MiraclePill—which you believe will cause lower blood pressure in patients who are at risk (you are the expert, so you can define this). You aren’t sure of the correct dosage: you think somewhere between 0 and 100 mg per week. \vskip .2in

How would you design a randomized trial to assess MiraclePill? \vskip .2in

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the intervention?
\item What is the outcome?
\item What is the follow-up period between treatment and outcome?
\item Who is the target population?
\item How are unit-level quantities aggregated to a population-level summary?
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Even numbered groups}
You are a social scientist focused on the underrepresentation of women in computer science at the BA level. You develop a new mentorship program to connect entering first-year women computer science majors with recent women Cornell alumni from CS. The alumni agree to meet one-on-one with the first-year undergraduates a couple times a year. You want to randomize some element of this program in order to test its effectiveness. \vskip .2in

How would you design a randomized trial to assess the mentorship program? \vskip .2in

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the intervention?
\item What is the outcome?
\item What is the follow-up period between treatment and outcome?
\item Who is the target population?
\item How are unit-level quantities aggregated to a population-level summary?
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%\subsection{Compare to observational evidence}

\begin{frame}
\huge Observational evidence \vskip .2in
Scroll down to Part 2
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Odd numbered groups}

Another medical researcher comes to you with observational evidence. ``I had 100 people in my office today. 50 of them tell me they take MiraclePill 100mg once per week. The other 50 tell me they do not take MiraclePill. Average blood pressure was lower for those who take MiraclePill.'' \vskip .2in

What do you say to this researcher? How is their evidence different from your target trial?

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Even numbered groups}

Another social scientist comes to you with observational evidence. ``Today I was at a gathering of women Cornell alumni from the CS and English departments. I went around and asked them if they ever engaged with CS alumni during college. 75\% of the CS graduates said yes, but only 10\% of the English graduates said yes. I think engaging with alumni is key to persistence in CS.'' \vskip .2in

What do you say to this researcher? How is their evidence different from your target trial?

\end{frame}

%\subsection{A hypothetical target trial for an observational claim}

\begin{frame}

\huge Hypothetical target trial \vskip .2in
Scroll down to Part 3

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Odd numbered groups}

A researcher (with whom you may disagree) says to you: “Coming to office hours frequently causes student success in the classroom.” \vskip .2in

Your task is to create the details that would make this observational claim specific. 
What is the target trial?  \vskip .2in

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the hypothetical intervention?
\item What is the outcome?
\item What is the follow-up period between treatment and outcome?
\item Who is the target population?
\item How are unit-level quantities aggregated to a population-level summary?
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Even numbered groups}

A researcher (with whom you may disagree) says to you: “Single parenthood causes poverty. If poor women would marry, then they would no longer be poor.”  \vskip .2in

Your task is to create the details that would make this observational claim specific. 
What is the target trial?  \vskip .2in

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the hypothetical intervention?
\item What is the outcome?
\item What is the follow-up period between treatment and outcome?
\item Who is the target population?
\item How are unit-level quantities aggregated to a population-level summary?
\end{enumerate}
